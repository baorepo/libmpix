libmpix test suite
==================

The libmpix project uses the desktop suite to validate all the software parts.

This allows to efficiently develop new components and have robust debugging tools such as
[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).

On top of this, platform-specific tests will be added to cover the platform-specific parts.
